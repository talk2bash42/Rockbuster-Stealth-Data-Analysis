# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Initiative
This initiative was completed as a component of the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program. The repository includes SQL code samples used for querying the dataset, a data dictionary, and the final report featuring visualizations and findings.

## Tools Utilized
The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL. Visualization efforts were executed using Tableau.

## Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, previously a global movie rental chain, is adapting to competitive pressures from online streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime by planning to initiate an online video rental service. This strategic move leverages their existing movie licenses.

The management board of Rockbuster Stealth has posed several key business inquiries requiring data-backed responses to shape their strategic direction for 2020. The critical queries include:
* Identifying the movies that have significantly impacted revenue positively or negatively.
* Determining the average duration of video rentals.
* Understanding the geographical distribution of Rockbuster customers.
* Identifying locations of customers with significant lifetime value.
* Examining if sales figures differ across various geographic regions.
