# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Initiative
This initiative includes a repository containing SQL code samples for dataset queries, a data dictionary, and the final report with visualizations and analytical conclusions.

## Tools Utilized
PostgreSQL was used for data analysis, while Tableau was employed for creating visualizations.

## Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, once a global movie rental chain, is navigating competitive pressures from streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime by planning to launch an online video rental service using their existing movie licenses.

The Rockbuster Stealth management board has requested data-driven insights to inform their 2020 strategic planning. They are interested in answers to the following key business questions:
* Which movies have had the most and least impact on revenue?
* What is the average rental duration for videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are the customers with high lifetime value located?
* Do sales figures vary across different geographic regions?
